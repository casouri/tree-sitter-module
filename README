I should clarify that this module is NOT a standalone tree-sitter
module. It is supossed to be used with an upcoming tree-sitter
intergration in Emacs core.

To build the language definition for a particular language, run

    ./build.sh <language>

eg,

    ./build.sh html

The dynamic module will be in dist directory

To build all modules at once, run

    ./batch.sh

This gives you C, JSON, Go, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python, Typescript,
C#, C++, Rust. More can be added to batch.sh unless it's directory
structure is not standard.
